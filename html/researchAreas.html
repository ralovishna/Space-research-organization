            <p><strong>
                    Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites.
                    In-space propulsion exclusively deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should
                    not be confused with space launch or atmospheric entry.
                    <br><br>
                    Several methods of pragmatic spacecraft propulsion have been developed, each having its own
                    drawbacks and advantages. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often
                    monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping, while a few use momentum
                    wheels for attitude control. Russian and antecedent Soviet bloc satellites have used electric
                    propulsion for decades,[not verified in body] and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting
                    to use them for north-south station-keeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use
                    chemical rockets as well, although a few have used electric propulsion such as ion thrusters and
                    Hall-effect thrusters. Various technologies need to support everything from small satellites and
                    robotic deep space exploration to space stations and human missions to Mars.

        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>
                    Spacecraft design is a process where systems engineering principles are systemically applied in
                    order to construct complex vehicles for missions involving travel, operation or exploration in outer
                    space. This design process produces the detailed design specifications, schematics, and plans for
                    the spacecraft system, including comprehensive documentation outlining the spacecraft's
                    architecture, subsystems, components, interfaces, and operational requirements, and potentially some
                    prototype models or simulations, all of which taken together serve as the blueprint for
                    manufacturing, assembly, integration, and testing of the spacecraft to ensure that it meets mission
                    objectives and performance criteria.
                    <br><br>
                    Spacecraft design is conducted in several phases. Initially, a conceptual design is made to
                    determine the feasibility and desirability of a new spacecraft system, showing that a credible
                    design exists to carry out the mission. The conceptual design review ensures that the design meets
                    the mission statement without any technical flaws while being internally consistent. Next, a
                    preliminary design is carried out, where the focus is on functional performance, requirements
                    definition, and interface definition at both subsystem and system levels. <br><br> The preliminary
                    design
                    review evaluates the adequacy of the preliminary design. In the following phase, detailed design is
                    drawn and coded for the system as a whole and all the subsystems, and a critical design review is
                    performed where it is evaluated whether the design is sufficiently detailed to fabricate, integrate,
                    and test the system.

            <p><strong>
                    Microgravity research can lead to novel discoveries about everything from how molecules interact to
                    how the human body adapts to spaceflight and can translate into benefits for healthcare,
                    agriculture, industry, and much more, on Earth. Humanity has been performing scientific research in
                    space for decade.<br><br>
                    Microgravity is a unique environment where the effects of gravity are reduced or removed. This
                    environment is created in freefall. In space, freefall is achieved by “falling around” the Earth in
                    the International Space Station; on the Earth, freefall is achieved in special research aircraft
                    that fly in parabola-like maneuvers. Anyone can experience freefall simply by jumping in the air:
                    the moment your feet leave the ground, you are in freefall and experience exactly the same sensation
                    as astronauts floating inside the space station! Microgravity is very important in the study of
                    Space Science because the processes and phenomena normally hidden by dominant gravitational effects
                    become more easily observable.<br><br> An example of a physical science experiment in freefall is
                    the study
                    of how a liquid occupies a partially filled container: on the ground, a liquid tends to pool at the
                    bottom of its container, but in microgravity the liquid can behave strangely and may occupy both
                    ends of its container with a void in the middle, creating new challenges in the design of spacecraft
                    liquid fuel tanks and life support systems.
