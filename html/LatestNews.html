        <h1>Chandrayaan-3 Landed successfully</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Chandrayaan-3</strong> is the third mission in the Chandrayaan
                programme, a series of lunar-exploration missions developed by the Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO). The mission consists of a Vikram lunar lander and a Pragyan lunar rover was
                launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5
                August, and India became the first country to touch down near the lunar south pole, at 69¬∞S, the
                southernmost lunar landing on 23 August 2023 at 18:04 IST (12:33 UTC), ISRO became the first agency
                to land near the south pole of the moon in its first attempt and overall the fourth space agency to
                successfully land on the Moon, after USSR, NASA and the CNSA.
                <br><br>
                Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar
                orbit on 5 August, and became the first lander to touch down near the lunar south pole on 23 August
                at 18:03 IST (12:33 UTC), making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and at 69¬∞S,
                the southernmost lunar landing, until IM-1 landed further southwards in Malapert A crater on 22 February
                2024. The lander was not built to withstand the cold temperatures of the lunar night, and
                sunset over the landing site ended the surface mission twelve days after landing.The propulsion
                module, still operational, transited back to a high Earth orbit from lunar orbit on 22 November 2023 for
                continued scientific observations of Earth. It operated until 22 August 2024.

        <h1>Aditya-L1 launched</h1>
        <div class="div1">

            <p><strong>Aditya-L1</strong> spacecraft has completed its first halo orbit around the Sun-Earth
                L1 point. The Aditya-L1 mission is an Indian solar observatory at Lagrangian point L1, launched on
                September 2, 2023 and was inserted in its targeted halo orbit on January 6, 2024. Aditya-L1 spacecraft
                in the Halo orbit takes 178 days to complete a revolution around the L1 point.

                During its travel in the halo orbit, Aditya-L1 spacecraft will be subjected to various perturbing forces
                that will cause it to depart from the targeted orbit. It underwent two station-keeping maneuvers on
                February 22 and June 7, respectively, to maintain this orbit. Today's 3rd station-keeping maneuver has
                ensured that its travel continued in to thesecond halo orbit path around L1.
                <br><br>
                This journey of Aditya L1 around Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point involves modeling of complex dynamics.
                The understanding of various perturbing forces acting on the spacecraft helped in determining the
                trajectory accurately and planning precise orbit maneuvers. With today's maneuver, the state-of-the-art
                flight dynamics software developed in-house at URSC-ISRO for the Aditya-L1 missions stands fully
                validated.
                <br><br>
                The blue trajectory, in the figure, is the orbit around the Lagrangian point L1. This trajectory is a 3
                dimensional trajectory, and what is shown is the projection of it in the X-Y plane. SK#1, 2 & 3 are the
                Station Keeping maneuvers by the Aditya-L1 spacecraft. The final firing of the thrusters, ie. SK#3 on
                July 2, placed the spacecraft back in the required orbit. If an accurate firing was not done, the
                spacecraft would have moved away in a trajectory shown in green colour. The X-Y axes are marked in
                distance of km, with Lagrangian point L1 at the origin..

        <h1>Mangalyaan(Mars Orbiter Mission)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Mangalyaan </strong>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), unofficially known as Mangalyaan (Sanskrit:
                Ma·πÖgala 'Mars', YƒÅna 'Craft, Vehicle'), was a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014.
                It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It
                was India's first interplanetary mission and it made ISRO the fourth space agency to achieve Mars
                orbit, after Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency. It made India the first
                Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the second national space agency in the world to do so on its
                maiden attempt after the European Space Agency did in 2003.
                <br><br>
                The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre
                (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at
                09:08 (UTC) on 5 November 2013. The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on
                28 October 2013. The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven
                apogee-raising orbital man≈ìuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).After a
                298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.
                <br><br>
                The mission was a technology demonstrator project to develop the technologies for designing, planning,
                management, and operations of an interplanetary mission. It carried five scientific instruments.
                The spacecraft was monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command
                Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru with support from the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at
                Bengaluru, Karnataka..

        <h1>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) </strong> is an expendable
                medium-lift launch vehicle designed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It
                was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into Sun-synchronous
                orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV in 1993, only commercially available from
                Russia. PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).
                <br><br>
                Some notable payloads launched by PSLV include India's first lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, India's first
                interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan), India's first space observatory, Astrosat and
                India's first Solar mission, Aditya-L1.
                <br><br>
                PSLV has gained credibility as a leading provider of rideshare services for small satellites, owing to
                its numerous multi-satellite deployment campaigns with auxiliary payloads, usually ride-sharing along
                with an Indian primary payload.As of June 2022, PSLV has launched 345 foreign satellites from 36
                countries.Most notable among these was the launch of PSLV-C37 on 15 February 2017, successfully
                deploying 104 satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit, tripling the previous record held by Russia for the
                highest number of satellites sent to space on a single launch,until 24 January 2021, when
                SpaceX launched the Transporter-1 mission on a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 143 satellites into orbit.
                <br><br>
                Payloads can be integrated in tandem configuration employing a Dual Launch Adapter.Smaller
                payloads are also placed on equipment deck and customized payload adapters.
