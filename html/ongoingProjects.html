        <h1>X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>XPoSat (X-ray Polarimeter Satellite) </strong> is India's first dedicated
                polarimetry mission to study various dynamics of bright astronomical X-ray sources in extreme
                conditions. The spacecraft will carry two scientific payloads in a low earth orbit. The primary payload
                POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-rays) will measure the polarimetry parameters (degree and angle of
                polarization) in medium X-ray energy range of 8-30 keV photons of astronomical origin. The XSPECT (X-ray
                Spectroscopy and Timing) payload will give spectroscopic information in the energy range of 0.8-15 keV.
                <br><br>
                The emission mechanism from various astronomical sources such as blackhole, neutron stars, active
                galactic nuclei, pulsar wind nebulae etc. originates from complex physical processes and are challenging
                to understand. While the spectroscopic and timing information by various space based observatories
                provide a wealth of information, the exact nature of the emission from such sources still poses deeper
                challenges to astronomers. The polarimetry measurements add two more dimension to our understanding, the
                degree of polarization and the angle of polarization and thus is an excellent diagnostic tool to
                understand the emission processes from astronomical sources. The polarimetric observations along with
                spectroscopic measurements are expected to break the degeneracy of various theoretical models of
                astronomical emission processes. This would be the major direction of research from XPoSat by Indian
                science community.
                <br><br>
                XPoSat payloads:<br>

                <strong>POLIX</strong><br><br>
                POLIX is an X-ray Polarimeter for astronomical observations in the energy band of 8-30 keV. The payload
                is being developed by Ramam Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore in collaboration with U R Rao Satellite
                Centre (URSC). The instrument is made of a collimator, a scatterer and four X-ray proportional counter
                detectors that surrounds the scatterer. The scatterer is made of low atomic mass material which causes
                anisotropic Thomson scattering of incoming polarised X-rays. The collimator restricts the field of view
                to 3 degree x 3 degree so as to have only one bright source in the field of view for most observations.
                POLIX is expected to observer about 40 bright astronomical sources of different categories during the
                planned lifetime of XPoSat mission of about 5 years. This is the first payload in the medium X-ray
                energy band dedicated for polarimetry measurements.
                <br><br>
                <strong>XSPECT</strong><br>
                XSPECT is an X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing payload onboard XPoSat, which can provide fast timing and
                good spectroscopic resolution in soft X-rays. Taking advantage of the long duration observations
                required by POLIX to measure X-ray polarization, XSPECT can provide long-term monitoring of spectral
                state changes in continuum emission, changes in their line flux and profile, simultaneous long term
                temporal monitoring of soft X-ray emission in the X-ray energy range 0.8-15 keV. An array of Swept
                Charge Devices (SCDs) provide an effective area >30 cm2 at 6 keV with energy resolution better than 200
                eV at 6 keV. Passive collimators are used to reduce the background by narrowing the field of view of
                XSPECT. XSPECT would observe several types of sources viz X-ray pulsars, blackhole binaries,
                low-magnetic field neutron star (NS) in LMXBs, AGNs and Magnetars.

        <div class="div1">

            <p><strong>The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) </strong>is a
                small-lift launch vehicle developed by ISRO to deliver 500 kg (1,100 lb) payload to low Earth orbit (500
                km (310 mi)) or 300 kg (660 lb) payload to Sun-synchronous orbit (500 km (310 mi)).The rocket
                supports multi-orbital drop-offs capability for small satellites.
                <br><br>
                The maiden flight SSLV-D1 was conducted from First Launch Pad on 7 August 2022, however, the
                payload failed to reach the intended orbit.The second flight SSLV-D2 was successful in delivering
                payload into orbit on 10 February 2023.
                <br><br>
                SSLV is made keeping low cost, low turnaround time in mind with launch-on-demand flexibility under
                minimal infrastructure requirements. It is capable of carrying multiple satellites. Once SSLV is
                operational, NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) and a group of Indian companies will manage the mass
                production and launch activities

        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Satish Dhawan </strong>Launch Vehicle Mark-3 or LVM3 (previously referred as the
                Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III or GSLV Mk III)[a] is a three-stage medium-lift
                launch vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Primarily designed to launch
                communication satellites into geostationary orbit,it is also due to launch crewed missions under
                the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. LVM3 has a higher payload capacity than its predecessor,
                GSLV.
                <br><br>
                After several delays and a sub-orbital test flight on 18 December 2014, ISRO successfully conducted the
                first orbital test launch of LVM3 on 5 June 2017 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
                <br><br>
                Total development cost of project was â‚¹2,962.78 crore (equivalent to â‚¹45 billion or US$540 million in
                2023).In June 2018, the Union Cabinet approved â‚¹4,338 crore (equivalent to â‚¹58 billion or US$700
                million in 2023) to build 10 LVM3 rockets over a five-year period.
                <br><br>
                The LVM3 has launched CARE, India's space capsule recovery experiment module, Chandrayaan-2 and
                Chandrayaan-3, India's second and third lunar missions, and will be used to carry Gaganyaan, the first
                crewed mission under Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. In March 2022, UK-based global communication
                satellite provider OneWeb entered into an agreement with ISRO to launch OneWeb satellites aboard the
                LVM3 along with the PSLV, due to the launch services from Roscosmos being cut off, caused by the Russian
                invasion of Ukraine.The first launch took place on 22 October 2022, injecting 36 satellites
                into Low Earth orbit.
