        <h1>Vikram Sarabhai (The Visionary Founder)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Vikram Sarabhai </strong>(1919-1971) was a visionary Indian physicist and astronomer, widely
                celebrated as the "Father of the Indian Space Program."
                Born on August 12, 1919, he played a crucial role in establishing India's space research and nuclear
                power capabilities. In 1947, he
                founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, which initially focused on cosmic rays and
                atmospheric studies but later
                expanded into various fields of physics. <br>Sarabhai's contributions extended beyond space science; he
                was instrumental in founding
                numerous educational and research institutions,including the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad
                and the Nehru Foundation for
                Development. He also established the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts with his wife, Mrinalini
                Sarabhai, highlighting his diverse
                interests in culture and the arts. <br>Among his notable projects was the initiation of India's
                satellite program, leading to the launch
                of Aryabhata in 1975. His legacy is further recognized through posthumous honors such as the Padma
                Vibhushan. Sarabhai's vision and
                leadership laid the groundwork for India's advancements in science and technology, making a lasting
                impact on the nation's development.

        <h1>Satish Dhawan (Architect of Modern ISRO)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Satish Dhawan </strong>(1920-2002) was a pioneering Indian mathematician and aerospace engineer,
                often hailed as the father of experimental
                fluid dynamics research in India. Born in Srinagar and educated in both India and the United States, he
                made significant contributions to
                the fields of turbulence and boundary layers, which are critical for aerospace engineering. <br>In 1972,
                Dhawan became the third chairman
                of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and served as secretary in the Department of Space. He
                played a key role in advancing
                India's space program, overseeing the development of important projects like the Satellite Launch
                Vehicle (SLV) and the Polar Satellite
                Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which helped position India among the leading space-faring nations. <br>Dhawan
                was known for his exemplary
                leadership style. After a failed satellite launch in 1979, he took full responsibility for the failure,
                publicly expressing confidence
                in his team's abilities. This humility and focus on teamwork inspired his colleagues, leading to a
                successful launch of the satellite
                in 1980. <br>Beyond his work at ISRO, Dhawan served as the director of the Indian Institute of Science
                (IISc) in Bangalore from 1962
                to 1981, where he established the country's first supersonic wind tunnel and made notable contributions
                to boundary layer theory. <br>
                In recognition of his contributions, the Sriharikota launch center was renamed the Satish Dhawan Space
                Centre after his passing in 2002.
                Several institutions and facilities have been named in his honor, reflecting his lasting impact on

                program and oversaw the development of the SITARA trajectory simulation software. <br>Before becoming
                ISRO's chairman, Sivan was Director of the Liquid
                Propulsion Systems Centre and the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. Under his leadership, ISRO launched
                Chandrayaan-2 in July 2019, marking Indiaâ€™s second lunar
                mission. Although the Vikram lander and Pragyan rover faced challenges, the orbiter remains operational.
                <br> Sivan's term as chairman was extended to
                January 2022. However, he faced scrutiny following a complaint from the Central Vigilance Commission
                regarding the alleged irregular recruitment of his
                son at the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre. He is currently the Chairman of the Board of Governors at
                the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore.

        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Dr. Sreedhara Panicker Somanath</strong>, born in July 1963, is an accomplished Indian aerospace
                engineer currently serving as the chairman of the Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO). Under his leadership, ISRO successfully executed the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which
                achieved a historic soft landing near the lunar south pole on
                August 23, 2023, making India the first country to land in that region and the fourth globally to
                achieve a soft lunar landing. <br>Somanath's career at ISRO began
                in 1985 at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), where he contributed to the Polar Satellite Launch
                Vehicle project and later became the associate director. He
                played a pivotal role as project director of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III and
                served as the director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre
                until January 2018. He took over the directorship of VSSC from K. Sivan, who had transitioned to ISRO
                chairman, before assuming the chairman role himself in January 2022.
                <br>He holds a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras, where he was awarded an honorary Doctorate
                of Science during the 18th Annual Convocation of SRM Institute of
                Science and Technology on September 25, 2023. Somanath's contributions to launch vehicle systems
                engineering and pyrotechnics have significantly advanced India's space capabilities.
