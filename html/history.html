        <h1>Aryabhata Satellite (1975)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Aryabhata</strong> was India's first satellite, named after the astronomer. It was launched on
                19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar, a Soviet rocket launch and development site in Astrakhan Oblast,
                using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. It was built by ISRO and launched by the Soviet Union as a part
                of the Soviet Interkosmos programme, which provided access to space for friendly states.It was
                launched by India on 19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar, a Russian rocket launch and development site
                in Astrakhan Oblast using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. The satellite was built by the Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO). The launch was part of an agreement between India and the Soviet Union
                directed by UR Rao and signed in 1972. This agreement allowed the USSR to use Indian ports for tracking
                ships and launching vessels in return for launching various Indian satellites.On 19 April 1975, the
                satellite's 96.46-minute orbit had an apogee of 619 kilometres (385 mi) and a perigee of 563
                kilometres (350 mi), at an inclination of 50.7 degrees. It was built to conduct experiments in X-ray
                astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft was a 26-sided polyhedron 1.4 metres (4.6 ft)
                in diameter, with all faces (except the top and bottom) covered with solar cells.A power failure halted
                experiments after four days and 60 orbits, with all signals from the spacecraft lost after five days of
                operation. However, the spacecraft mainframe remained active until March 1981. Eventually, the satellite
                entered Earth's atmosphere on 10 February 1992 due to orbital decay.</p>

        <h1>Rohini Satellite (1980)</h1>
        <div class="div1">

            <p><strong>Rohini Satellite 1 (RS-1)</strong> was launched on July 18, 1980, at 8:04 AM IST from the
                Satish Dhawan Space Centre using the SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle). The satellite achieved an orbit of
                305 km Ã—
                919 km with an inclination of 44.7Â°, successfully reaching its intended trajectory just eight minutes
                after liftoff.
                Weighing 35 kg, RS-1 was spin-stabilized and equipped with instruments such as a digital Sun sensor,
                magnetometer,
                and temperature sensors, generating 16 watts of power through solar panels. Its mission life was
                designed
                for 1.2 years, with an orbital lifespan of approximately 20 months, providing valuable data on the
                fourth stage
                of the SLV. The budget for the SLV project, including the satellite, was around â‚¹38 million
                (approximately $1 million
                at the time), reflecting India's significant investment in advancing its space capabilities despite
                earlier launch failures.

        <h1>INSAT-1B Satellite (1983)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>INSAT-1B </strong>was an Indian communications satellite launched in 1983 as part of the Indian
                National Satellite System.
                Operating in geostationary orbit at 74 degrees east, it had a design life of seven years but was
                eventually replaced
                by INSAT-1D, becoming a backup satellite. In 1992, it was relocated to 93 degrees east and was
                decommissioned in
                August 1993. Built by Ford Aerospace, INSAT-1B weighed 1,152 kg at launch and featured twelve C band and
                three S
                band transponders powered by a solar array. Deployed by Space Shuttle Challenger during the STS-8
                mission,
                it encountered initial issues with its solar array but became operational by October 1983. After
                decommissioning,
                it was moved to a graveyard orbit above geosynchronous altitude and remains there, with its last known
                orbit parameters
                as of November 2013.</p>

        <h1>PSLV (1994)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)</strong> development began in 1978 under S. Srinivasan,
                aiming to deliver a 600 kg payload to a 550 km
                sun-synchronous orbit. After evaluating 35 configurations, a design was finalized featuring a solid core
                first stage and a
                liquid-fueled second stage. By 1981, the goals shifted to delivering a 1000 kg payload to a 900 km
                orbit.
                The first PSLV launch occurred on September 20, 1993, but an attitude control issue caused the payload
                to fail
                to reach orbit. Despite this setback, the PSLV successfully completed its second mission in 1994 and has
                since
                become a reliable launcher, with no failures after 1997, aside from one in 2017. PSLV supports Indian
                and foreign satellite
                launches, especially for low Earth orbit, and underwent numerous upgrades over the years. Notably, it
                launched India's Mars Orbiter
                Mission in 2013. In June 2018, the Indian government approved â‚¹6,131 crore for 30 operational flights
                from 2019 to 2024, and ISRO
                is transitioning PSLV production to private industry. In 2022, a contract was signed with Hindustan
                Aeronautics Limited and Larsen
                & Toubro for five PSLV-XL vehicles, signaling increased private sector involvement in India's space
                program.

        <h1>GSLV (2001)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) </strong>project was initiated in 1990 to
                establish India's capability to
                launch geosynchronous satellites. GSLV incorporates proven components from the Polar Satellite Launch
                Vehicle (PSLV), including
                the S125/S139 solid rocket boosters and the liquid-fueled Vikas engine. To achieve the thrust necessary
                for geostationary
                transfer orbit (GTO), a cryogenic upper stage powered by a LOX/LH2 engine was included, although India
                lacked this technology
                at the time. <br>The first GSLV development flight (Mk I) launched on April 18, 2001, but failed to
                reach its intended orbit.
                The rocket was declared operational after the successful second flight, which launched the GSAT-2
                satellite. From its initial
                launch until 2014, GSLV had a mixed record, with only two successful missions out of seven, earning it
                the nickname "naughty
                boy." <br> Standing 49 meters tall and with a lift-off mass of 415 tons, the GSLV is a three-stage
                vehicle featuring solid,
                liquid, and cryogenic stages. It has a payload fairing measuring 7.8 meters long and 3.4 meters in
                diameter, which protects
                the vehicle's electronics and spacecraft during ascent. The GSLV employs S-band telemetry and C-band
                transponders for vehicle
                monitoring, with a redundant inertial navigation system guiding the launch from lift-off to payload
                injection. The GSLV can
                deliver approximately 5,000 kg to a low Earth orbit (LEO) or 2,500 kg to a geostationary transfer orbit
                (for the Mk II version).

        <h1>Chandrayaan-1 (2008)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Chandrayaan-1</strong>, India's inaugural mission to the Moon, was launched on October 22, 2008,
                from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre
                (SDSC) SHAR in Sriharikota. This mission marked a significant milestone for India's space exploration
                efforts, aiming to enhance our
                understanding of the Moon's surface and composition. <br>Once in orbit, Chandrayaan-1 operated at an
                altitude of 100 km above the
                lunar surface, utilizing a suite of 11 scientific instruments developed by various institutions in
                India. These instruments were
                designed for comprehensive chemical, mineralogical, and photo-geologic mapping of the Moon. Key
                objectives included identifying and
                mapping the distribution of various elements and minerals, as well as studying the Moon's topography and
                surface features. <br> In May
                2009, after successfully completing its primary mission objectives, the spacecraft's orbit was raised to
                200 km to extend its operational
                capabilities. Over its mission, Chandrayaan-1 completed more than 3,400 orbits around the Moon,
                collecting a wealth of data that contributed
                to our understanding of lunar geology and mineralogy. <br> The mission was particularly notable for its
                discovery of water molecules on the
                lunar surface, a groundbreaking finding that has influenced subsequent lunar research and exploration
                strategies. Unfortunately,
                communication with the spacecraft was lost on August 29, 2009, marking the conclusion of the mission.
                Despite its relatively short
                operational life, Chandrayaan-1 was a resounding success, paving the way for future Indian lunar
                missions and solidifying India's position
                in the global space exploration community.

        <h1>Mangalyaan (2013)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)</strong>, or Mangalyaan, was launched by the Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO) on November 5, 2013, making
                it India's first interplanetary mission. It successfully entered Mars orbit on September 24, 2014,
                positioning India as the first Asian nation
                to reach Mars and the fourth globally, following the Soviet Union, NASA, and the European Space Agency.
                <br> The mission launched from the
                Satish Dhawan Space Centre using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and spent a month in Earth
                orbit before executing a trans-Mars
                injection. MOM carried five scientific instruments designed for studying the Martian surface and
                atmosphere, and it was monitored from ISRO's
                control center in Bengaluru. <br>On October 2, 2022, ISRO announced that MOM had lost communication with
                Earth after entering a long eclipse period in
                April that it was not designed to endure, ultimately declaring the mission inactive. <br>The MOM concept
                originated in 2010,
                and it was approved in August 2012. The mission was accomplished at a cost of about â‚¹454 crore
                (approximately $54 million), utilizing technology
                from the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter. MOM's success also facilitated collaboration with NASA for communication
                support, laying groundwork for future
                joint missions.

        <h1>Chandrayaan-2 (2019)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Chandrayaan-2</strong>, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on July 22,
                2019, is India's second lunar exploration mission,
                consisting of an orbiter, the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan rover. Its primary objective is to map the
                Moon's surface composition and locate water resources.
                <br>The mission launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre aboard a GSLV Mk III M1 rocket, reaching
                lunar orbit on August 20, 2019. The Vikram lander
                attempted to make a soft landing on September 6, 2019, but unfortunately crashed due to a software
                error. Despite this setback, the lunar orbiter continues
                to operate and gather scientific data. <br> The development of Chandrayaan-2 began in collaboration with
                Roscosmos, but India eventually took full
                responsibility for the lander and rover after delays from the Russian side. The mission was initially
                scheduled for launch in 2018 but faced multiple
                postponements due to technical issues. <br> The scientific goals of the orbiter include studying lunar
                topography, mineralogy, and the distribution of
                water ice, particularly in the south polar region. The mission's total cost was approximately â‚¹9.78
                billion (around $141 million), with the spacecraft
                weighing about 3,850 kg (8,490 lb) at launch. <br> Chandrayaan-2 exemplifies ISRO's growing capabilities
                in space exploration and paves the way for future
                missions, including the successful Chandrayaan-3, launched in 2023.

        <h1>Chandrayaan-3 (2023)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Chandrayaan-3</strong> is India's third lunar mission, developed by the Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO). It consists of a Vikram lander and a
                Pragyan rover, launched on July 14, 2023, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The spacecraft
                successfully entered lunar orbit on August 5, 2023, and on August
                23, it became the first to land near the lunar south pole at 69Â°S, making India the fourth country to
                achieve a soft landing on the Moon, following the USSR,
                NASA, and CNSA. <br>The mission aims to explore the south pole region, which is believed to contain
                significant amounts of ice. This ice could provide valuable
                insights into lunar history and serve as a resource for future human missions, offering oxygen, drinking
                water, and fuel. <br>The Vikram lander, while not
                designed to withstand the lunar night, operated for 12 days after landing before sunset ended its
                surface mission. However, the propulsion module remains
                functional, having transitioned back to a high Earth orbit for continued observations. <br>The
                Chandrayaan-3 mission also features a Laser Retroreflector

        <h1>Aditya L1 (2023)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Aditya-L1</strong> is India's first dedicated solar mission, developed by the Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO) to study the Sun's atmosphere. It is
                positioned about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in a halo orbit around Lagrange Point 1 (L1), where
                it will investigate solar magnetic storms and their
                effects on the Earth's environment. The mission aims to enhance our understanding of solar dynamics and
                space weather. <br>Launched aboard PSLV C57 on
                September 2, 2023, Aditya-L1 successfully entered its intended orbit and was placed at the L1 point on
                January 6, 2024. <br><br>Mission Objectives
                The key objectives of Aditya-L1 include:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Observing the dynamics of the Sun's chromosphere and corona.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Studying coronal heating, the physics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and their
                origins.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Investigating the particle environment at L1.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Analyzing processes leading to solar eruptions.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Studying the composition and dynamics of solar wind.
                <br><br> History <br>The mission was conceptualized in January 2008 and initially planned as a smaller
                satellite in low Earth orbit. However, it was later expanded
                into a comprehensive observatory for solar and space environment studies at L1, with a budget of â‚¹378
                crores. <br>On January 11, 2024, ISRO successfully deployed
                a 6-meter magnetometer boom equipped with high-accuracy sensors to measure the interplanetary magnetic
                field. This dual-sensor system minimizes the spacecraft's
                magnetic influence on measurements, ensuring accuracy in data collection. <br>Aditya-L1 represents a
                significant advancement in India's capabilities for solar
                observation and research, contributing to global efforts in understanding solar dynamics and space
                weather phenomena.
