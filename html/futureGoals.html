        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR)</strong> is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) observatory being jointly developed by
                NASA and ISRO. NISAR will map the entire globe in 12 days and provide spatially and temporally
                consistent data for understanding changes in Earth's ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level
                rise, ground water and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides. NISAR.
                It carries L and S dual band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which operates with Sweep SAR technique to
                achieve large swath with high resolution data. The SAR payloads mounted on Integrated Radar Instrument
                Structure (IRIS) and the spacecraft bus are together called an observatory.
                <br><br>
                This flagship partnership would have major contributions from both agencies. NASA is responsible for
                providing the L-Band SAR payload system in which the ISRO supplied S-Band SAR payload and both these SAR
                systems will make use of a large size (about 12m diameter) common unfurl able reflector antenna . In
                addition, NASA would provide engineering payloads for the mission, including a Payload Data Subsystem,
                High-rate Science Downlink System, GPS receivers and a Solid State Recorder.
                <br><br>
                This would be the first dual frequency radar imaging mission in L-Band & S-Band using an advanced Sweep
                SAR technique to provide L & S band space-borne SAR data with high repeat cycle, high resolution, and
                larger swath, with capability of full-polar metric and interferometric modes of operation. It will
                provide a means of disentangling and clarifying spatially and temporally complex phenomena, ranging from
                ecosystem disturbances, to ice sheet collapse and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis,
                volcanoes, and landslide.

            <p><strong>The Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM)</strong>, unofficially known as
                Shukrayaan is a planned Indian
                Space Research Organisation (ISRO) mission to study the surface and atmosphere of Venus.
                <br><br>
                Funds were released in 2017 to complete preliminary studies, and solicitations for instruments were
                announced. The orbiter was expected to have a science payload capability of approximately 100
                kilograms (220 lb) with 500 W available power.The initial elliptical orbit around Venus is expected
                to be 500 km (310 mi) at periapsis & 60,000 km (37,000 mi) at apoapsis. On 18 September 2024, the
                mission was formally approved by the Indian government and the launch date was set to March 2028. On
                1 October 2024, ISRO announced the launch date to be 29 March 2028, with a journey of 112 days, thereby
                reaching the Venusian orbit on 19 July 2028.
                <br><br>
                The three broad research areas of interest for this mission include surface/subsurface stratigraphy and
                re-surfacing processes; studying the atmospheric chemistry, dynamics and compositional variations, and
                studying solar irradiance and solar wind interaction with Venus' ionosphere.The mission may carry
                out research on Venus' active volcanic hotspots, lava flows and their patterns.The probe may
                reexamine claims of phosphine on Venus,as the findings are currently thought to be in error

        <h1>Mars Orbiter Mission 2 (Mangalyaan 2)</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong></strong>India's space program has consistently impressed the global
                community with its ambitious yet cost-effective missions, and the upcoming Mars Orbiter Mission 2 (MOM
                2) by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to continue this trend. MOM 2 aims to deploy
                a rover and introduce a pioneering helicopter to Mars, elevating India's stature as a key player in
                space exploration and is estimated to launch in the latter half of 2024.
                <br><br>
                The successful insertion of the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also known as Mangalyaan, into Martian
                orbit, ISRO expressed its intention to launch a second mission to Mars during the Engineers Conclave
                conference in Bengaluru on 28 October 2014. This second mission, referred to as MOM 2, was envisioned to
                utilize the LVM3 launch vehicle, which debuted on 5 June 2017 and was capable of placing MOM 2 on a
                direct-to-Mars trajectory, unlike the lighter PSLV XL rocket used for MOM 1.

        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>The Lunar Polar Exploration Mission</strong> (LUPEX), is a planned
                joint lunar mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Japan Aerospace Exploration
                Agency (JAXA). The mission would send an uncrewed lunar lander and rover to explore the south pole
                region of the Moon no earlier than 2028.It is envisaged to explore the permanently shadowed
                regions and to determine the quantity and quality of water on the Moon. JAXA is likely to provide the
                H3 launch vehicle and the rover, while ISRO would be providing the lander.
                <br><br>
                The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) signed an Implementation Arrangement (IA) in December 2017
                for pre-phase A, phase A study and completed the feasibility report in March 2018 with Japan Aerospace
                Exploration Agency (JAXA) to explore the polar regions of Moon for water with a joint Lunar
                Polar Exploration Mission (LUPEX) that would be launched no earlier than 2028.
                <br><br>
                ISRO and JAXA held the Joint Mission Definition Review (JMDR) in December 2018. By the end of 2019, JAXA
                concluded its internal Project Readiness Review.
                <br><br>
                Since Chandrayaan-2's lander crashed on the Moon during its landing attempt in September 2019, India
                started to study a new lunar mission named Chandrayaan-3 as a repeat attempt to demonstrate the landing
                capabilities needed for the LUPEX.

        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong> The Bharatiya Antariksha Station </strong>,'Indian Space Station'
                (ISO: Bhāratīya Antarikṣa Sṭeśan) is a planned modular space station to be constructed by India and
                operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The space station would weigh 52 tonnes and
                maintain an orbit of approximately 400 kilometres above the Earth, where astronauts could stay for 3-6
                months. Originally planned to be completed by 2030, it was later postponed to 2035 due to delays
                caused by technical issues related with the Gaganyaan crewed spaceflight mission and the COVID-19
                pandemic in India. As of December 2023, the first module is expected to be launched in 2028 on an
                LVM3 launch vehicle, with the remaining modules to be launched by 2035 on the Next Generation Launch
                Vehicle (Soorya).
                <br><br>
                In 2019, ISRO chief K. Sivan presented the features of the proposed space station for the first time,
                saying that the space station may weigh up to 20 tons. Three years later, in his New Year's speech
                delivered before retiring as chairman, Sivan stated that India's first crewed spaceflight project
                Gaganyaan had completed the design phase and entered into the testing phase, hinting that the
                organization has achieved a breakthrough in reaching the space mission milestone.
                <br><br>
                In 2023, chief S. Somanath said: "Our Gaganyaan programme is towards a human space flight capability to
                space and once that happens, we will be able to look at space station building in subsequent modules.
                The timeline for this space station project spans the next 20 to 25 years. We will be definitely looking
                at manned exploration, a human spaceflight for a longer duration, space exercise there in our
                agenda". Following on from the Gaganyaan project, completing the station and conducting a crewed Moon
                landing by the year 2040 has been set as ISRO's goal for the upcoming decade, with a whole host of new
                projects and undertakings to come up in support of the mission

        <h1>Chandrayaan-4</h1>
        <div class="div1">
            <p><strong>Chandrayaan-4 </strong>,is a planned lunar sample return mission of the Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO) and the fourth iteration in its Chandrayaan lunar exploration programme.The
                mission is currently under conceptualization and expected to launch around 2027. It is planned to
                return up to 3 kg (6.6 lb) of lunar regolith from near Statio Shiv Shakti, the landing site of
                Chandrayaan-3.
                <br><br>
                The plan for a lunar sample return mission was revealed by the director of Space Application Centre
                (SAC), Nilesh M Desai on 17 November, 2023 during the 62nd foundation ceremony of Indian Institute of
                Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune. This was confirmed by S. Somanath, the chairman of ISRO during
                the National Space Science Symposium held in Goa on 26 February 2024.He said that the mission is
                extremely challenging as it incorporates multiple launches, docking capability and robotic capability.
                He expressed the confidence buildup over the success of 'hop' operation of the lander and Earth return
                operation performed by the propulsion module of Chandrayaan-3.
                <br><br>
                On 18 September 2024, Chandrayaan-4 received approval from The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister
                Narendra Modi for ₹2,104.06 crore (US$250 million) and is expected to be completed within 36
                months.The mission will have five modules that will be carried to space on two different
                launches. The mission is designed to land on the lunar surface, collect samples, store them in a vacuum
                container, and bring them back. The mission will also see docking and undocking — two spacecraft
                aligning and coming together in orbit.
